# Smart-Pet-Feeder (Version 1/ Prototype)
This is a documentation for my Final ECE (Electrical and Computer engineering) High School Project, Which is The Smart Pet feeder. This project also serves as a prototype for a newer, upgraded version of The Smart Pet Feeder that I am working on.

# Introduction for The Smart Pet Feeder
First of all, this project is a system that automizes the process of feeding pets and track habitual consumption behaviours of pets. 
It serves as a solution for problems such as: forgetting to refill pets food and water (can be harmful for the pets) and also tracking consumption behaviours of pets that might be new-borns, old, or pets that suffer from background diseases (Tracking their consumption habits can be beneficial for ensuring their health and right amount of consumption).

The system has several functions:
- Food and Water tracking: Tracks how much water and food is left in the bowls (in this case containers). There are both physical and digital displays for the water and food amounts.
- Automated Food and water refill: Refills both the food container and the water container when food's or water's level is low. The refill has an option for an audible buzz sound that serves as a warning sound.
- Pets eating and drinking (consumption) behaviour tracking: Tracks which pet is currently drinking or eating, is he eating or is he drinking and when is he drinking or eating.
